The goal of this repository is to get familiar with the MujoCo environment and learn about the dynamics of Caasie robot

This Code based is inspired by: https://github.com/ZhaomingXie/cassie_rl_env
The objective of this code base is to get you familar with running a robot model in a physics based simulator.
The Cassie model is created by Dynamic Robotics Laboratory {refer https://github.com/osudrl/cassie-mujoco-sim}
This code base and the additions that will be added on it was created by Shuzhen Luo (a former Post Doc in our lab(BIRO lab))
